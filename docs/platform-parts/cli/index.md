The Electrode Native CLI is the Electrode Native platform command line client. The Electrode Native CLI is written in JavaScript (ES6) and runs in Node 6+.

Use the Electrode Native CLI to access platform functionality. However, if you are working only on the mobile application side, you may not need to use the Electrode Native CLI at all.

The Electrode Native CLI is actually composed of two clients: a `global client` and a `local client`.
