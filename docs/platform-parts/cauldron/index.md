A Cauldron is a centralized document database that is used to store information about mobile application versions, native dependencies, and information about MiniApps. There is one cauldron per mobile application. With appropriate permissions, you can use the Electrode Native CLI commands to access and modify the data stored within the Cauldron. Some Electrode Native CLI commands are relying on the Cauldron for their execution.
